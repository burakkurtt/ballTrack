# ballTrack
Ball track algorithm using OpenCV libraries. Algorithm also included PID controller 

This algorithm detects the object using its color. 
Algorithm takes desired color from user and detects this colour from background colors.   
Also ALgorithm Apply the PID controller to control quadcopter [throttle, elevator, aileron, rudder] values
Then sends the control inputs to flight controller.
